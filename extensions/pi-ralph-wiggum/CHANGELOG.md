# Changelog

## [0.2.1] - 2026-05-07

### Changed
- Declare the `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` peer and development dependency used by runtime imports.
- Update Pi extension imports to the new `@earendil-works` namespace.

## 0.2.0 - 2026-04-19

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** SKILL.md `name` renamed `ralph-wiggum` → `pi-ralph-wiggum` to match the parent directory (both in the repo and after `pi install npm:@tmustier/pi-ralph-wiggum`). This removes the `[Skill conflicts]` warning pi emitted on every startup, but it also changes the skill's public identifier — explicit invocations must now use `/skill:pi-ralph-wiggum` instead of `/skill:ralph-wiggum`. Thanks to @ishanmalik for reporting ([#12](https://github.com/tmustier/pi-extensions/issues/12)).
- Repo directory renamed `ralph-wiggum/` → `pi-ralph-wiggum/` as part of the same fix. Git-source users referencing `~/pi-extensions/ralph-wiggum/…` in their pi config should update the path to `~/pi-extensions/pi-ralph-wiggum/…`. The npm package name (`@tmustier/pi-ralph-wiggum`) is unchanged.
- Renamed the README's `Install` section to `Installation` so it matches the skill validator's expectations.

## 0.1.7 - 2026-04-19

### Fixed
- Ralph loops no longer silently stop after auto-compaction or `/compact`. On session reload, `currentLoop` is now rehydrated from the on-disk state (most-recently-updated active loop wins on ties), so `ralph_done`, `agent_end`, and `before_agent_start` continue to function. Thanks to @elecnix for the detailed report and proposed fix ([#11](https://github.com/tmustier/pi-extensions/issues/11)).

## 0.1.5 - 2026-02-03

### Added
- Add preview image metadata for the extension listing.

## 0.1.4 - 2026-02-02

### Changed
- **BREAKING:** Updated tool execute signatures for Pi v0.51.0 compatibility (`signal` parameter now comes before `onUpdate`)
- **BREAKING:** Changed `before_agent_start` handler to use `systemPrompt` instead of deprecated `systemPromptAppend` (Pi v0.39.0+)

## 0.1.3 - 2026-01-26
- Added note clarifying this is a flat version without subagents.

## 0.1.1 - 2026-01-25
- Clarified that agents must write the task file themselves (tool does not auto-create it).

## 0.1.0 - 2026-01-13
- Initial release.
