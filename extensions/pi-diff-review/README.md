# pi-diff-review

This is pure slop, see: https://pi.dev/session/#d4ce533cedbd60040f2622dc3db950e2

It is my hope, that someone takes this idea and makes it gud.

Native diff review window for pi, powered by [Glimpse](https://github.com/hazat/glimpse) and Monaco.

```
pi install git:https://github.com/badlogic/pi-diff-review
```

## What it does

Adds two commands to pi:

- `/diff-review` opens the native review window for the whole repository.
- `/plan-review <file-path>` opens the same review window, but scoped to a single reviewable file. The path can be absolute, relative to your current working directory, or relative to the repository root.

Both commands:

1. open a native review window
2. let you switch between `git diff`, `last commit`, and `all files` scopes when available
3. show a collapsible sidebar with fuzzy file search
4. show git status markers in the sidebar for changed files and untracked files
5. lazy-load file contents on demand as you switch files and scopes
6. let you draft comments on the original side, modified side, or whole file
7. insert the resulting feedback prompt into the pi editor when you submit

## Requirements

- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- Node.js 20+
- `pi` installed
- internet access for the Tailwind and Monaco CDNs used by the review window

### Windows notes

Glimpse now supports Windows. To build the native host during install you need:

- .NET 8 SDK
- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime
