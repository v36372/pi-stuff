 * user can view can also be opened. Root precedence: server-supplied root(s)
 * override the client `base`; then `base`; then an absolute `filePath`'s own
 * directory; then cwd. Each root resolves `filePath` independently, so a
 * relative path is resolved correctly per-root (not only against the first).
