# background-jobs

Run quick, long-lived, and interactive shell commands through managed terminal
sessions without blocking the agent or losing track of child processes.

## Agent tools

- `bash` — the single default command tool
  - quick commands return their final output normally
  - commands still running after `yield-time_ms` return a terminal ID
  - omitting `timeout` sets no hard deadline; yielded commands keep running until completion, an explicit stop, or session shutdown
  - an explicit integer `timeout` from 1 to 86,400 seconds enforces a hard deadline
  - `tty: true` allocates a PTY for prompts, REPLs, watch processes, and control characters
- `terminal_write` — write characters to a yielded terminal or poll with empty input
- `job_output` — read only output produced since the previous cursor
- `job_kill` — stop one terminal after explicit confirmation

The three terminal-control tools are registered but initially inactive, keeping
their schemas out of ordinary requests. The first yielded `bash` call activates
them additively for the rest of the session, and its result names the newly
available tools and terminal ID.

The extension provides its own managed `bash` when loaded independently. When
`better-native-pi` is also loaded, that extension owns the single combined
`bash` definition and refreshes it as soon as the managed terminal service is
available. Both load orders expose the same schema and behavior.

Every command receives Pi's current `PI_SESSION_ID`, `PI_SESSION_FILE`,
`PI_PROVIDER`, `PI_MODEL`, and `PI_REASONING_LEVEL` values when available. The
extension replaces inherited values when each process starts, so nested Pi
sessions cannot leak stale parent metadata into managed terminals.

For an interactive prompt, call `bash` with `tty: true`; if it yields, send the
answer with `terminal_write`. `terminal_write` also accepts literal control
characters, including `\u0003` for Ctrl+C. PTY mode uses the system `expect`
utility on macOS and `script` from util-linux on Linux, avoiding a native Node
dependency.

## User experience

Managed commands keep the same reason-first headline, bordered command, and
`│` output gutter as `better-native-pi`. Foreground completions omit terminal
metadata; once a command yields, a final muted row identifies the terminal
without mixing metadata into command output:

```text
• Running exercise live terminal updates 10s
  ╭ bash ─────────────────────────────╮
  │ for i in {1..12}; do …            │
  ╰───────────────────────────────────╯
  │ demo tick 09
  │ demo tick 10
  └ ● demo-loop-a1b2c3d4 · running · /ps
```

`terminal_write` and `job_output` use the same colored `•` headline, distinct
heading-colored terminal name, accent reasoning, dim `│` command-output gutter, tail-first
collapse, and `└` metadata hierarchy: `Interacted with <terminal> to <goal>`,
`Waited for <terminal> to <goal>`, or `Read from <terminal> to <goal>`. The
`job_kill` uses the stopping icon while the request is in flight, then renders
the terminal's final status icon and color. No-op stop requests render as
`◷ <id> is already timed out.` instead of plain status text. The `/jobs` and
`/ps` live viewer uses that same normal command-output treatment.

After terminals yield into the background, they appear in the shared top-right
overlay stack:

```text
 Jobs ● 2 running · /ps
 ● frontend dev server
   bun run dev
 ● test watcher
   bun test --watch
```

Each terminal gets two compact rows for its description and command, with a TTY
marker when applicable. Internal terminal IDs stay out of the overlay and remain
available through `/ps`. The card shows up to three terminals plus an overflow hint, hides when
none are running, and stays hidden while commands are still inside their initial
foreground yield window. It also hides on terminals narrower than 90 columns or
shorter than 10 rows. Use `/overlay` or `Ctrl+Shift+O` to toggle the shared stack.
The footer remains clear so job state is not duplicated.

Commands:

- `/jobs` — list terminals with status, duration, and latest output
- `/ps` — alias for `/jobs`
- `/jobs output <id>` — open the live latest-output viewer
- `/jobs stop <id>` — stop one terminal
- `/jobs stop all` — stop every active terminal after one confirmation

Each terminal uses explicit lifecycle states:

- `●` running
- `◌` stopping
- `✓` completed
- `◷` timed out
- `■` killed
- `×` failed

Once a command yields, its transcript card becomes an immutable snapshot with a
`/ps` hint. Live output and final status move to the explicitly opened viewer,
which prevents hidden or off-screen cards from redrawing long transcripts.
Completion state remains persisted invisibly for session restore without adding
a duplicate transcript entry.

## Output and lifecycle guarantees

- Polls return cursor-based deltas rather than repeating old output.
- Foreground command updates are coalesced after 250ms of quiet, with a 500ms maximum wait during continuous output.
- Yielded transcript cards are immutable and never start polling or invalidate the transcript.
- The live viewer subscribes to output/status events only while open, skips unchanged revisions, pauses redraws while unfocused, and uses a 5-second fallback check for missed events.
- Closing the viewer disposes its subscription and timers; historical jobs never subscribe.
- Collapsed cards and the viewer render bounded latest-output tails with width-keyed caches; expanded cards remain available on explicit request.
- Historical terminal interaction cards freeze elapsed time at the result's observation timestamp, so unrelated streaming renders remain byte-stable and preserve a scrolled viewport.
- Tool output remains below Pi's 50KB limit.
- Explicit timeouts and session shutdown send SIGTERM first, wait up to five seconds, then escalate surviving process trees to SIGKILL.
- Pi's normal SIGINT, SIGTERM, and SIGHUP shutdown path remains in control and gives `session_shutdown` time to complete that escalation.
- PTY wrapper and child process groups are both terminated to prevent orphans.
- A synchronous `process.on('exit')` reaper is retained only as a last resort for hard exits that bypass or interrupt graceful session cleanup. It does not install signal listeners or suppress default signal behavior.
- Yielded command lifecycle changes update the shared overlay and any open live viewer without emitting desktop notifications or mutating historical transcript rows.
